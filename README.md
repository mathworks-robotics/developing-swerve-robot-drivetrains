# developing-swerve-robot-drivetrains
SimulinkÂ® models for design and development of robot swerve drivetrains. Use these models to simulate different drivetrain configurations under different environmental parameters, derive motor specifications, test maximum pushing forces, and evaluate control algorithms for autonomous and remote-controlled applications.
